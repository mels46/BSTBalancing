Class 'Tree' is implemented as a binary search tree which, in addition to the element
, also has a defined priority based on which the tree is balanced using rotations during
the application of the Insert and Erase methods. The criterion for positioning tree elements (nodes)
is based on the priority attribute. Each node has a higher priority than its children, and lower than its parent.
